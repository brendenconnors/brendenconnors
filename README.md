### Hi there 👋 I'm Brenden

I am currently working as a Basketball Data Scientist for the Sacramento Kings. Previously I was working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Symend](https://symend.com/). I received my BS in Mathematics from Montana State University - Billings in 2019, and my MS in Data Science from the University of Montana 🐻 in 2021. Feel free to check out my [website](https://brendenconnors.github.io/) (WIP) to check out my projects/posts.

## Interests Include
- Both traditional statistical learning and deep learning as a whole
- Machine learning and analytics for sports (specifically 🏀)
- Recommender systems
- Data visualization 

I am always looking to broaden my knowledge in all DS/ML! If you have anything you'd like to share, would like to collaborate, or just want to say "Hello", feel free to send me a message on LinkedIn, or shoot me an email.
